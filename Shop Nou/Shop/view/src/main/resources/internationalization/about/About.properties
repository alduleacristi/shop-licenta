header = Our application is designed exclusively in Java EE 6 and run in JBoss AS 7 application server. The connection to the database (MySQL) and application security is achieved through server(with security module that implements the Java API Authentication Authorization Service - JAAS). The client web interface is  developed using the framework PrimeFaces 4.0 which is based on JSF 2.2. To facilitate the use of bookmarks we used PrettyFaces 3.3.3 that maps in an elegant manner URLs. The management of the images that involves storing and their efficient search is achieved through 2.3.7 Jackrabbit JCR's. Accessing individual each picture is done by using a REST service. Also, this service is used for recovery password section which consists of sending a URL in the email client, through which you access the page that allows you to change your password.
footer = To meet the needs of more customers, the app features an internationalization system (EN / RO). The management of view's components is done using Managed Beans. Also the service in the application is provided by using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) components stored on the server, which facilitates modular architecture for enterprise applications. The mapping of the database is done using Hibernate JPA 2.1 API. To search for items stored in the database we use indexes provided by Hibernate Search Hibernate Search Analyzer 4.2.0 and 4.4.0. Also, the search is implemented autocomplete functionality. The search is performed by keyword and then filtering is also possible depending on the product value. Another feature available through our application is the pdf report generation (using itextpdf 5.4.3), XML (using JAXB), csv and json.
